      " \n",
      "Boosting is an iterative technique which adjusts the weight of an observation based on the last \n",
      "classification. If an observation was classified incorrectly, it tries to increase the weight of this observation \n",
      "and vice versa. Boosting in general decreases the bias error and builds strong predictive models. However, \n",
      "they may over fit on the training data. \n",
      " \n",
      "Pros \n",
      "Ø Boosting technique takes care of the weightage of the higher accuracy sample and lower accuracy \n",
      "sample and then gives the combined results. \n",
      "Ø Net error is evaluated in each learning steps. It works good with interactions. \n",
      "Ø Boosting technique helps when we are dealing with bias or underfitting in the data set. \n",
      "Ø Multiple boosting techniques are available. For example: AdaBoost, LPBoost, XGBoost, \n",
      "GradientBoost, BrownBoost \n",
      "Cons \n",
      "Ø Boosting technique often ignores overfitting or variance issues in the data set. Ø It increases the complexity of the classification. \n",
      "Ø Time and computation can be a bit expensive. \n",

      "There are multiple areas where Bagging and Boosting technique is used to boost the accuracy. \n",

      "Random forest is a versatile machine learning method capable of performing: \n",
      "• regression  \n",
      "• classification \n",
      "• dimensionality reduction \n",
      "• treat missing values \n",
      "• outlier values \n",
      " \n",
      "It is a type of ensemble learning method, where a group of weak models combine to form a powerful \n",
      "model. The random forest starts with a standard machine learning technique called a “decision tree” \n",
      "which, in ensemble terms, corresponds to our weak learner. In a decision tree, an input is entered at the \n",
      "top and as it traverses down the tree the data gets bucketed into smaller and smaller sets. \n",
      "In Random Forest, we grow multiple trees as opposed to a single tree. To classify a new object based on \n",
      "attributes, each tree gives a classification. The forest chooses the classification having the most votes \n",
      "(Over all the trees in the forest) and in case of regression, it takes the average of outputs by different \n",
      "trees. \n",

      "about 66% of the total set. \n",
      "2. At each node: \n",
      "a. For some number  m (see below) , m predictor variables are selected at random from all \n",
      "the predictor variables. \n",
      "b. The predictor variable that provides the best split, according to some objective function, \n",
      "is used to do a binary split on that node. \n",
      "c. At the next node, choose another m variables at random from all predictor variables and \n",
